## Usage 

There are two key files:
- elegant.sty : defines the environment (e.g., package dependency, newly defined command) in which the .tex file will run based on.
- main.tex : the main file to generate the latex beamer file.

For your purpose, you can download these two files to Overleaf or your local computer, and make changes to deploy your presentations.

For the .bib file, it contains the BibTex information of the reference paper.

## Modification

To modify the current format, you can view the elegant.sty file and define your command or style.
